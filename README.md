# Taste-Finder

## Description

Welcome to our project! This is a team project of a Food review App built with React Native and Express.js framework.


## Purpose

The purpose of the application is to allow users to find restaurants based on the userâ€™s desired food search. The user can find the specific food first and can find the restaurants recommended by other users of the food.
This application focuses on reviews of the food rather than that of restaurants.

## Parts I work on
- Create initial wireframe for the app to display to app flow between pages.
- Create Color version of prototype to finalise the user interface
- Implement Autocomplete feature at the search bar <br />
It allows user to enter any food keywords to search related review. Once user type first 3 characters, any input related food name will be displayed as a dropdown list below the search bar so user need not to type the whole word in the search process and minimize the searching time.
- Modify UI on Home page, Search result page to make them more aesthetics
- Fetch Data on the Home page to display the top 10 list
- Create tabs bar at bottom for navigation between screens
- Create loading page after clicking the search icon on home page with modal and progress bar
